## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Expense Tracker project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Node.js:** (LTS version recommended) - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **Yarn** (comes with Node.js installation)
* **Git:** [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ayushpandey101/Expense-Tracker.git](https://github.com/ayushpandey101/Expense-Tracker.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Expense-Tracker
    ```

3.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    The frontend part of your project is likely within a subfolder (e.g., `frontend/expense-tracker`).
    ```bash
    cd frontend/expense-tracker # Adjust this path if your frontend is named differently
    npm install
    # OR if you use yarn
    # yarn install
    ```

4.  **Install Backend Dependencies (if applicable):**
    *(**Note:** If your backend is in a separate folder like `backend` or `server`, navigate to that folder and install its dependencies. Skip this if your project is purely frontend for now.)*
    ```bash
    # cd ../../backend # Adjust path to your backend folder
    # npm install
    # OR
    # yarn install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    From your frontend directory (`Expense-Tracker/frontend/expense-tracker/`):
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # OR if you use yarn
    # yarn dev
    ```
    This will start the frontend development server, usually accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or a similar port). The exact URL will be displayed in your terminal.

2.  **Start the Backend Server (if applicable):**
    *(**Note:** If you have a backend, you'll need to start it separately. Replace `server.js` with your actual backend entry file.)*
    From your backend directory (`Expense-Tracker/backend/` or `Expense-Tracker/server/`):
    ```bash
    # node server.js
    # OR if you have a start script in package.json
    # npm start
    # OR
    # yarn start
    ```
    Ensure your backend is running and configured correctly to communicate with the frontend. You might need to set up environment variables for database connections, API keys, etc. (check for a `.env.example` file).
